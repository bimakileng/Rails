1.	int + int = int example 2+3=5
	float+float=float example 2.5+3.2=5.8
	float+int=float example 3.5+2=5.5
	Strings are concatenated not added 

2. x*y/z+y   x*(y+x)/z
	the evaluations are not the same due to the order of precence of operators

3. 	In the focus 1.0 appeared first and therefore the interpreter that it was dealing with floats, whereas in the second 	case 5 an integer comes first therefore the interpreter assumes it's dealin with integers. as such an integer is 		returned

4. a) x=4 	b) x=4.5

5.a)	a=3, b=2, c=a/b ->(3/2)=1			b)a=5, b=2, c=a/b-> (5/2)=2

6. avg_temp = temp_winter + temp_spring + temp_summer + temp_f/4
in this statement there is a logical error in that only temp_f is divided by 4 the only way to correct this is introducing parenthesis like this;
avg_temp = (temp_winter + temp_spring + temp_summer + temp_f)/4


7. Logical errors occur as a result of misrepresentation of data in a program in otherwords the program will compile and run but will give wrong output, example if you write a/b instead of a%b. Whereas syntax  errors occur due to type mismath according to compilation or interpretation rules of the programming language. example a="Hello",b=3 c=a/b
